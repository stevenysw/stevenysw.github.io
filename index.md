## About Me
I am a Research Data Scientist at [Google](https://ads.google.com/). I obtained my Ph.D. in [Statistics from the University of California, Los Angeles](http://statistics.ucla.edu/), in March 2025, under the supervision of [Dr. Oscar Hernan Madrid Padilla](https://hernanmp.github.io/).

Before that, I graduated with Highest Distinction from the [University of California, Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu), with a dual degree in [Applied Mathematics](https://math.berkeley.edu/) and [Statistics](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/). Throughout my undergraduate years, I had the privilege of collaborating with [Dr. Carl Boettiger](https://www.carlboettiger.info/) as a research intern at [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) and with [Dr. Philip B. Stark](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/) as a research assistant. 

My industry experience includes internships across leading organizations: Data Science & Statistical Research Team at [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/) (June–December 2022), Payments Data Science and Engineering Team at [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) (June–September 2023), and AIM-DS Team at [Google](https://ads.google.com/) (June–September 2024).

## Research
My doctoral research focused on non-parametric statistics and causal inference, with applications in computational biology, social science, and economics.
